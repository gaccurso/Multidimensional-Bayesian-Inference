# Multidimensional-Bayesian-Inference

This Python script performs a multidimensional Bayesian Inference analysis on nine-dimensional heteroscedastic data with multivariate gaussian uncertainties. This code uses an MCMC ensembler to maximise the general likelihood function when fitting linear models.
